I am broadly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, wireless communications, and optimization. My research spans across:

### 🧠 Federated Learning Over Wireless Networks
- Focused on optimizing FL in cell-free massive MIMO and hybrid VLC/RF environments.
- Designed scalable algorithms to reduce communication latency and improve convergence.

### 📊 Multi-modal Foundation Models (MM-FMs)
- Exploring deployment of large pre-trained models over IoT/edge environments.
- Working on privacy-preserving training across distributed multi-modal data.

### 🏥 AI for Healthcare
- Applying FL and MM-FMs in computational pathology, wearable devices, and hospital networks.

### ⚙️ Communication-Efficient Optimization
- Using PSO, Lyapunov optimization, and adaptive compression in decentralized settings.
