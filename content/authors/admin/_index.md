      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto. In my work, my goal is to enable reliable, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective advanced machine learning services for end-users—connecting people and systems across the globe. My research focuses on designing such systems across connected infrastructures—from edge IoT devices to large-scale data centers. It spans three core areas: **trustworthy distributed learning**, **smart networks**, and **advanced machine learning models**.
