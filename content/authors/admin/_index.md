I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto. In my work, my goal is to enable reliable, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective advanced machine learning services for end-users—connecting people and systems across the globe. My research focuses on designing such systems across connected infrastructures—from edge IoT devices to large-scale data centers. It brings together three core areas: **trustworthy distributed learning**, **next-generation networks**, and **advanced machine learning models**.
